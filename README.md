# Medical Shap-E
This repository contains an implementation of [Shap¬∑E](https://github.com/openai/shap-e), a powerful tool for generating 3D assets using implicit functions, based on the work by OpenAI. Shap¬∑E is a conditional generative model that creates textured meshes and neural radiance fields, offering an efficient and user-friendly way to generate high-quality 3D models for various applications. Additionally, this implementation includes code for converting `PLY` files into `STL` format.
Official paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02463).

## Installations
To run the code in colab, you will need to install, clip (by OpenAI), blobfile and trimesh (for PLY-STL conversion).

```
pip install blobfile
pip install trimesh
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
```
